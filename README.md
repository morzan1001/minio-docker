# MinIO Docker Builder

This repository automatically creates multi-arch MinIO container images based on the regular upstream releases from [minio/minio](https://github.com/minio/minio).

Unfortunately, Minio has decided to stop providing Docker containers itself [see issue](https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/21647).
